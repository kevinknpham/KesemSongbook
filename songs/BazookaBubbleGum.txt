Bazooka Bubble Gum
all campfire loud
My momma gave me a penny
She said to buy a henny
But I didn't buy no henny

(Chorus)
Instead, I bought some bubblegum. Bazooka-zooka bubblegum
Bazooka-zooka bubblegum

My momma gave me a nickel
She said to buy a pickle
But I didn't buy no pickle

(Chorus)

My momma gave me a dime
She said to buy a lime
But I didn't buy no lime

(Chorus)

My momma gave me a quarter
She said to buy some water
But I didn't buy no water

(Chorus)

My momma gave me a dollar
She said to buy a collar
But I didn't buy no collar

(Chorus)

My momma gave me a five
She said to stay alive
But I didn't stay alive

(Chorus)
