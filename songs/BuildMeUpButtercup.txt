Build Me Up Buttercup
all
Why do you build me up (Build me up)
Buttercup baby just to
let me down (Let me down)
And mess me around
And then worst of all (Worst of all)
You never call baby
When you say you will (Say you will)
But I love you still

I need you (I need you)
More than anyone darlin'
You know that I have from the start
So build me up (Build me up) Buttercup
Don't break my heart

I'll be over at ten
You tell me time and again
But you're late
I wait around and then
I went to the door
I can't take any more
It's not you
You let me down again

(Hey hey hey!) Baby Baby
Try to find a little time
And I'll make you happy
I'll be home
I'll be waiting beside the phone
Waiting for you.

Why do you build me up.... To you I'm a toy
But I could be the boy You adore
If you'd just let me know
Although you're untrue
I'm attracted to you
All the more
Why do I need you so Baby Baby.....

Ooh ooh ooh
Why do build me up .....
