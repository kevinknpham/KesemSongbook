Button Factory
all repeat-after-me time-killers
Hi, my name is Joe
And I work in a button factory
I have a wife, and two kids
One day my boss came up to me
He said Joe "Are you busy?"
I said NO.
Can you press this button with your [right hand]?

Add one each time, while still doing all of the previous motions: left hand, right leg, left leg, nod your head, butt, tongue

LAST VERSE (note that you say YES):

Hi, my name is Joe
And I work in a button factory

One day my boss came up to me
He said Joe "Are you busy?"
I said YES.
