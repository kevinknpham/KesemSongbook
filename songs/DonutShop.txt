Donut Shop
all
Well, I ran around the corner 
and I ran around the block,
And I ran right in to a donut shop.
And I picked up a donut,
right out of the grease,
and I handed the lady a 5-cent piece.

Well, she looked at the nickel,
and she looked at me.
And she said, "This money's no good you see,
There's a hole in the middle,
and it goes right through!"
And I said, 
"There's a hole in your donut too!
Thanks for the donut, so long!"
