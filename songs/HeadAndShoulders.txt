Head and Shoulders
all repeat-after-me time-killers
Head and shoulders baby 1, 2, 3
I said head and shoulders baby 1, 2, 3
Head and shoulders head and shoulders head and shoulders baby 1, 2, 3

Knees and ankles baby 1, 2, 3
I said knees and ankles baby 1, 2, 3
Knees and ankles, knees and ankles, knees and ankles baby 1, 2, 3

Scoop the ice cream
Pick the apple
Around the world

(last verse, all together)
I said head and shoulders knees and ankles scoop the ice cream pick the apple around the world baby 1, 2, 3
