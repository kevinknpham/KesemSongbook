Jigga
all loud
Hey there _____, you're a real cool cat
You got a lot of this
And a lot of that
So don't be afraid of the boogie man
Just step right up and Jigga while you can

Jigga up, jigga jigga, jigga jigga
Jigga down, jigga jigga, jigga jigga
To the side, jigga jigga, jigga jigga
Other side, jigga jigga, jigga jigga
