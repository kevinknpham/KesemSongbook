Jungle Song
all repeat-after-me time-killers loud
I went to the jungle the other day
I saw a strange animal I have to say
With its arms like this
It went KWAH KWAH KWAH
And it went KWEE KWEE KWEE

I went to the jungle the other day
I saw a strange animal I have to say
With its arms like this
And its legs like this
It went KWAH KWAH KWAH
And it went KWEE KWEE KWEE

(repeat, adding a body part with each verse)
