Linger
all campfire
Mmm, I want to linger
Mmm, a little longer
Mmm, a little longer here with you
Mmm, it's such a perfect night
Mmm, it doesn't seem quite right
Mmm, that this should be my last with you

Mmm, and as the years go by
Mmm, I'll think of you and sigh
Mmm, This is goodnight and not goodbye

Mmm, I want to linger
Mmm, a little longer
Mmm, a little longer here with you

Mmm, and come September
Mmm, I will remember
Mmm, our camping days and friendships
True

Mmm, I want to linger
Mmm, a little longer
Mmm, a little longer here with you
