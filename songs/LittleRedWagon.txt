Little Red Wagon
all loud repeat-after-me time-killers
You can't ride in my little red wagon
Front seats broken
And the axel's draggin'
CHUGGA!...CHUGGA!...CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA!

SECOND VERSE, SAME AS THE FIRST, BUT A WHOLE LOT LOUDER AND A WHOLE LOT
WORSE!

Third verse, same as the first, but a whole lot nicer and a whole lot quieter.

FOURTH VERSE, SAME AS THE FIRST, BUT A WHOLE LOT LOUDER AND A WHOLE LOT
WORSE!
