Pineapple Hat
all loud repeat-after-me time-killers
I got a pineapple hat
And a sweet sweet tooth
If you catch me when I'm hungry
I'll be chomping into you

I got a pineapple hat
And a ticky tacky temper
If the fire started somewhere
You can bet I sparked the ember

I got a pineapple hat
And a pterodactyl smile
If you see me out your window
I'll be flying by like... hey

I got a pineapple hat
And a caterpillar crawl
All the crickets wanna kick it
Cuz they know I really ball
