Princess Pat
all repeat-after-me time-killers
The Princess Pat
Lived in a tree
She sailed across
The Seven Seas
She sailed across
The Channel too
And took with her
A Rickabamboo

CHORUS:
Now what is that?
It's something made
By the Princess Pat!
It's red and gold,
And purple too,
That's why it's called,
A Rickabamboo.

Now Captain Jack
Had a mightily fine crew,
They sailed across
The channel too,
But his ship sank
And yours will too,
If you don't TAKE!
A Rickabamboo.

CHORUS

The Princess Pat,
saw Captain Jack,
She reeled him in
And brought him back,
She saved his life
And his crew's too,
And do you know how?
With a Rickabamboo!

CHORUS
