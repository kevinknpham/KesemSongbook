Reese's Peanut Butter Cups
all campfire loud time-killers
Crowd: Hey '_____', do your thing!
I can't
Crowd: Why not!
I just can't
Crowd: Why not!

My back is aching,
My belt's too tight,
My hips are shaking
From the left to the right

To the left,
To the right,
To the left, to the right
To the left, to the right
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups
Sing this song to cheer us up
Wham bam choo choo train
C'mon
(repeat from start)
