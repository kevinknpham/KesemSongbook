Super California Surfer
all loud time-killers
Because I was afraid to surf
When I was just a lad,
My father took my board away
And told me I was bad (you're bad!)
And then one day I learned the word
That every surfer knows,
The longest word I've ever heard,
And this is how it goes...

Super California surfer, expert on the ocean.
Even though most of them
Do not wear suntan lotion.
When they hit a wave and crash
They're always in a motion.
Super California surfer, expert on the ocean.

Um didle iddle iddle um diddle lie,
Um didle iddle iddle um diddle lie,
oooooooooooohhhhhhhh
