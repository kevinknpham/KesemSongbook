Tarzan
all repeat-after-me time-killers
Tarzan
Swinging on a rubber band
Tarzan
Fell into a frying pan
Oooo that's hurts
Now Tarzan has a tan
And I hope he doesn't peel
Like a banana

Jane
Cruisin' in her airplane
Jane
Crashed into a window pane
Ooo, that hurts
Now Jane has a pain
And Tarzan has a tan
And I hope he doesn't peel
Like a banana

Cheetah
Dancing on a pizza
Cheetah
Feel and hurt his feet-za
Now Cheetah is velveeta
And Jane has a pain
And Tarzan has a tan
And I hope he doesn't peel
Like a banana
Like a banana
