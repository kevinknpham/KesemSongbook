The Alligator Song
all repeat-after-me time-killers
(Chorus)
Alligator
Alligator!
ALLLLIGATOR!
Can be your friend, can be your friend, can be your friend too.

The alligator is my friend
He has a lovely face
I'd rather see him in the swamp
Than to have him on my suitcase

(Chorus)

The alligator is my friend
He has a very lovely pelt
I'd rather see him in the swamp
Than to wear him on my belt

(Chorus)

This alligator is my friend
He has a very lovely snoot
I'd rather see him in the swamp
Than to wear him on my boot

(Chorus)

The alligator is my friend
Step on his tail, he'll be in a rage
I'd rather see him in the swamp
Than to see him in a cage

(Chorus)

The alligator is my friend
He can be your friend too
I'd rather have him as my friend,
then wear him as a shoe (point to shoe)

(Chorus)

The alligator is my friend
He likes to tease and flirt
I'd rather have him as my friend
Than wear him on my shirt (point to shirt)

(Chorus)

The alligator is my friend
You can do no worse
I'd rather have him as my friend
Than wear him as my purse.
