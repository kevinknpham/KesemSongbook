The Humpty Dumpty Song
all
Chorus:
Humpty dump
Hump humpty dumpty-dumpty Humpty dump
Hump humpty dumpty-dumpty

Humpty Dumpty sat a wall Humpty Dumpty Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men,
Said, HUNGH! AIN'T THAT FUNKY NOW

(Chorus)

Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet
Eating her curds and whey
Along came a spider and sat down beside Her
And said OOH AIN'T THAT FUNKY NOW!

(Chorus)
