The Jellyfish Song
all repeat-after-me time-killers
Arms Up!
Wrists together!

Chorus:
The jellyfish, the jellyfish, the jellyfish

(Add one action to the original two lines followed by the chorus)
Elbows together!
Clench your right kidney!
Knees Together!
Toes together!
Butt out! Way way out!
Tounge out!
Spin!
