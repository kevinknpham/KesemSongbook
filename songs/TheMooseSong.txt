The Moose Song
all repeat-after-me time-killers
There was a great big moose
He liked to drink a lot of juice
There was a great big moose
He liked to drink a lot of juice

Chorus:
Singing whoa-oh-oh-oh
Way-oh way-oh way-oh way-oh
Way-oh, way-oh!
Way-oh way-oh way-oh way-oh

The moose's name was Fred
He liked to drink his juice in bed
The moose's name was Fred
He liked to drink his juice in bed

Chorus

He drank his juice with care
Until he got some in his hair
He drank his juice with care
Until he got some in his hair

Chorus

Now he's a sticky moose
All covered in juice
Now he's a sticky moose
All covered in juice

Chorus
