Three Little Muffins
all repeat-after-me time-killers
There were three little muffins in the bakery shop
You know the kind with honey and the nuts on the top
'_____' came in with a penny to spare
And they grabbed themselves a muffin and they walked out of there!

Then there were two little muffins in the bakery shop
You know the kind with honey and the nuts on the top
'_____' came in with a penny to spare
And they grabbed themselves a muffin and they walked out of there!

Then there was one little muffin in the bakery shop
You know the kind with honey and the nuts on the top
'_____' came in with a penny to spare
And they grabbed themselves a muffin and they walked out of there!

Then there were no little muffins in the bakery shop
You know the kind with honey and the nuts on the top
'_____' came in with a penny to spare
And they were like, 'do you want a bagel?'
