Toast
all loud repeat-after-me time-killers
All around the country coast to coast
People always ask me what I like most
I don't wanna brag, I don't wanna boast
I just tell 'em I like toast.

I LIKE TOAST
YEAH TOAST

Wake up in the morning at 6 AM,
Grab a little butter, grab a little jam
Take a piece of bread, put it in the slot
I push the lever down and the wires get hot

I LIKE TOAST
YEAH TOAST

Now there's no secret to toast perfection
there's a dial on the side, just make your selection,
Light or dark, crispy or brown,
If it pops too soon, push it back down.

I LIKE TOAST
YEAH TOAST
