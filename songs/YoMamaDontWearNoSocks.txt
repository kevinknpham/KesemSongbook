Yo Mama Don't Wear No Socks
all campfire loud
Your Mama don't wear no socks
A ding dong
I saw 'em when she took 'em off
A ding dong
She threw them in the bed
A ding dong
Now dad sleeps in the shed
A ding dong dong dong dong
A ding dong dong dong dong
A ding dong

(repeat, changing the 5th and 7th lines to anything that rhymes)
